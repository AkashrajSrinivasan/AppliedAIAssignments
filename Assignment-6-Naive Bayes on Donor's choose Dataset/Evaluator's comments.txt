Hi Akashraj,
A comment was posted/updated by evaluator for your submission on Apply Naive Bayes on Donors Choose dataset

Comment:

Your submission has been evaluated, Akashraj. We have a few suggestions for you.

1) Whenever the training dataset is highly imbalanced, you can balance it either using any one of the techniques(like oversampling or undersampling) discussed in the course (or) you can use fit_prior = False, class_prior = [0.5, 0.5] parameters in MultinomialNB().

You can try using these parameters in both the cross-validation and the final model training phases and check if the model performance at prediction on the test data is improved.

2) In the ROC-AUC plot, the 'X' axis label should be 'False Positive Rate' and the 'Y' axis label should be 'True Positive Rate'.

3) In the 'Hyperparameter vs AUC' plot, as you are using log(alpha) values as the 'X' coordinates while plotting, the 'X' axis label should be 'log(alpha)'.

Follow the above suggestions for all your future assignments. Rest everything looks good with your work. This submission is accepted for now. You can go to the next assignment.

We request you NOT to post or publish your assignment code on public forums(like GitHub/Medium etc)  as it can lead to plagiarism by others.
